# Colorblind-Simu

The purpose of this project is to develop an image-processing program that simulates the visual experience of individuals with deuteranopia, the most severe form of red-green color blindness. This program
aims to assist user-interface designers in understanding the impact of color choices on individuals with color
vision deficiencies, specifically deuteranopia, and enables them to create more inclusive and accessible user
interfaces.
By implementing a file-processing tool, the program allows individuals with normal color vision to gain
insights into the limited color discrimination experienced by individuals with deuteranopia. It takes input and
output file names as command-line arguments and applies the necessary color transformations to generate a
modified image that accurately reflects how individuals with deuteranopia perceive colors. This functionality
empowers designers to make informed decisions about color usage, ensuring that their products are userfriendly and avoid potential color confusion for individuals with the most common types of color blindness.
To ensure optimal performance, the program leverages the efficiency of low-level Unix system calls for
file input and output operations, minimizing overhead and facilitating high-speed processing. By offering a
streamlined and efficient solution, the program supports industry professionals in efficiently evaluating and
adapting color schemes to enhance accessibility and usability for individuals with color vision deficiencies,
ultimately fostering inclusivity in user interface design.
